#TerraCraft
##Is a simple 2d block building sanbox game, with an infinite height and depth limit.
This project is only about two weeks old, and I only started learing C two weeks before that, so the code is probably bad.
This was made withought a game engine, but uses the Tigr graphics library along with with fastNoiseLite (licence in fastNoiseLite.h).
Currently support is for Windows only, but if you modify the saveAndLoad.c file you should be able to get it working on other operating systems.
